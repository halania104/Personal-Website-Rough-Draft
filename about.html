            I am an avid animal lover. I always grew up with a mix of different
            animals in the house. I have a Pembroke Welsh Corgi named Remy,
            after the rat from the Disney movie. <em>Ratatouille</em> One day, I
            hope to own a tortiose! I adore traveling. I make it a goal to
            travel to as many new places as I can every year. My favorite color
            is purple, my VS Code theme is Shades of Purple actually! Reading is
            one of my alltime favorite activities. I also love attending anime
            conventions and cosplaying!

          <p>
            I graduated from the University of Tennessee Knoxville with a degree
            in History and a minor in Geography. In addition to that, I also
            have a certification to teach English as a foreign language from The
            International TEFL Academy. During my time at university, I was
            lucky to be able to study abroad in Japan, where I studied Japanese
            culture, language, and art through CIEE.

          <p>
            Every family has that one person the parents run to for technical
            issues. The wifi isn't working, why won't my tv turn on? I've always
            been that technical one in my family. Despite this, I never
            considered doing anything with tech until after I graduated from
            university. My interest in coding started when I decided I wanted a
            versatile career path. There are so many things you can do with
            coding that the possibilities drew me in. However, I knew learning
            to code wasn't going to be easy. There are so many different ways to
            learn to code in 2022, so deciding how I was going to learn was a
            challenge in itself! Do I go back to university? A Bootcamp? Teach
            myself? One thing I do know is that there are fewer women in tech
            than men. That being said, I wanted to find something that had a
            belief in getting more women into tech. That's when I found
            SheCodes! They are an organization that focuses on getting more
            women into the tech industry. Just as the name implies, the program
            only teaches women. It is because of SheCodes that I have been able
            to code this very site. I learned at my own pace while working a
            full-time job, being a full-time dog mom, and moving cities! However
            coding is always changing and evolving, so I'm not done learning!
